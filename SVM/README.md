# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This project demonstrates Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks.

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. In this project, it is applied to a classification problem.

## What is SVM?

Support Vector Machine works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points into different classes with maximum margin.

Key ideas:
- Maximum margin classifier
- Support vectors
- Hyperplane decision boundary

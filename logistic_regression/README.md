# Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates Logistic Regression for classification problems.
It covers binary classification, multi-class classification, handling imbalanced datasets, and decision threshold analysis.

Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks where the output is categorical.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Binary Classification
- Classification with two classes (0 and 1)
- Sigmoid function
- Probability-based prediction
- Confusion matrix and accuracy

### 2. Multi-Class Classification
- Classification with more than two classes
- One-vs-Rest (OvR) approach
- Softmax concept (theoretical understanding)
- Evaluation using accuracy and classification report

### 3. Imbalanced Dataset Handling
- Problems caused by class imbalance
- Why accuracy can be misleading
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Techniques:
  - Class weighting
  - Resampling (Oversampling / Undersampling)
